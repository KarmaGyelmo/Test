# Example 1
x = 5
print(not(x > 3 and x<10)) #True because both conditions are True

# Example 2
y = 12
print(not(y>1 and y%5==0)) #false because both the condition is False

# Example 1
x=5
print(x<3 or x>10) #False because both the conditions are Fa;se

# Example 2
y=12
print(y<10 or y%2 ==0) #True because the second condition is True

#Examplw 1
x=5
print(not(x>3 and x<10)) #False because the condition inside the not is true

#Example 2
y=12
print(not(y>10 and y%5 ==0)) #True because the condition inside the not is False
